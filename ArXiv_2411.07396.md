## Abstract

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising method for addressing some of the memory-related challenges associated with Large Language Models (LLMs). Two separate systems form the RAG pipeline, the retriever and the reader, and the impact of each on downstream task performance is not well-understood. Here, we work towards the goal of understanding how retrievers can be optimized for RAG pipelines for common tasks such as Question Answering (QA). We conduct experiments focused on the relationship between retrieval and RAG performance on QA and attributed QA and unveil a number of insights useful to practitioners developing high-performance RAG pipelines. For example, lowering search accuracy has minor implications for RAG performance while potentially increasing retrieval speed and memory efficiency.

## 1 Introduction

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) (1) is gaining popularity due to its ability to address some of the challenges with using Large Language Models (LLMs), including hallucinations (2) and outdated training data (1; 3). RAG pipelines are made up of two disparate components: a retriever, which identifies documents relevant to a query from a given corpus, and a reader, which is typically an LLM prompted with a query, the text of the retrieved documents, and instructions to use this context to generate its response. However, it is unclear how a RAG pipeline’s performance on downstream tasks can be attributed to each of these components (1; 2).

In this work, we study the contributions of retrieval to downstream performance.¹ For this purpose, we evaluate pipelines with separately trained retriever and LLM components, as training retrieval-augmented models end-to-end is both more resource-intensive and obfuscates the contribution of the retriever itself. We aim to address questions that will enable practitioners to design retrieval systems tailored for use in RAG pipelines. For example, what are the weaknesses of the typical search and retrieval setup in RAG systems? Which search hyperparameters matter for RAG task performance?

# 2 Background

A RAG pipeline is made up of two components: a retriever and a reader. The retriever component identifies relevant information from an exterior knowledge base which is included alongside a query in a prompt for the reader model (8). This process has been used as an effective alternative to expensive fine-tuning (2; 9) and is shown to reduce LLM hallucinations (10).

## Retrieval models

Dense vector embedding models have become the norm due to their improved performance above sparse retrievers that rely on metrics such as term frequency (11). These dense retrievers leverage nearest neighbor search algorithms to find document embeddings that are the closest to the query embedding. Of these dense models, most retrievers encode each document as a single vector (12). However, multi-vector models that allow interactions between document terms and query terms such as ColBERT (13) may generalize better to new datasets. In practical applications, most developers refer to text embedding leaderboards (14) or general information retrieval (IR) benchmarks such as BEIR (15) to select a retriever.

## Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search

Modern vector embeddings contain $\geq 1024$ dimensions, resulting in severe search performance degradation (e.g., sitting through 170GB of data for general knowledge corpora like Wikipedia) due to the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, RAG pipelines often employ approximate nearest neighbor search as a compromise, opting for faster search times at the expense of some accuracy (1; 16). Despite this common practice, there is very little discussion in the literature regarding the optimal parameters for configuring ANN search, and the best way to balance the trade-off between accuracy and speed. Operating at a lower search accuracy could lead to massive improvements in search speed and memory footprint (for example, by eliminating the common re-ranking step (e.g., 17)).

# 3 Experiment setup

We conduct our experiments with two instruction-tuned LLMs: LLaMA (Llama-2-7b-chat) (18) and Mistral (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) (19). No further training or fine-tuning was performed. We avoided additional fine-tuning to ensure that our results are directly relevant to RAG pipelines currently being deployed across industry applications. Additional experiment details are in Appendix A.1.

## Question answering (QA) and attributed QA

For a query in a standard QA task, a RAG pipeline prompts an LLM to generate an answer based on information from a list of retrieved documents. In attributed QA, an LLM is also required to explicitly cite (e.g., by document ID) one or more of the documents used.

### 3.1 Retrieval

We chose to evaluate two high-performing, open-source dense retrieval models. For single vector embeddings, we relied on BGE-base to embed documents (bge-base-en-v1.5) (20), BEIR15 score of

## 3.2 Datasets

ASQA is a long-form QA dataset for factoid questions designed to evaluate a model’s performance on naturally-occurring ambiguous questions (23). It is made up of 948 queries and provides ground truth documents are based on a 12/20/2018 Wikipedia dump with 21M passages. We use the set of five gold documents provided by (5) which yields the best performance in their RAG pipeline.

QAMPARI is an open-domain QA dataset in which the 1000 queries have several answers that can be found across multiple passages (24). It is designed to be difficult for both retrieval and generation. As with ASQA, we use the five gold documents provided by (5) from the 2018 Wikipedia dump.

Natural Questions (NQ) is a dataset of look at questions submitted to the Google search engine (25). We follow (26) and use the KILT (27) version of the dataset, which consists of 2837 queries supported by 112M passages from a 2019 Wikipedia dump. It includes a short answer and at least one gold passage for each query. Though NQ has not traditionally corresponded to attributed QA, we adapt it to this task by simply prompting the language model to support statements with references to documents included in the context (See Figure 1).

## 3.3 Metrics

For retrieval, we report $recall@k$, which reflects the percentage of gold passages that have been retrieved in $k$ documents. We also report $search\ recall@k$, that is the percentage of the $k$ exact nearest neighbors (according to the retriever similarity) that have been retrieved in the $k$ approximate nearest neighbors.

Correctness on the QA tasks is quantified by string exact match recall (EM Rec.), or the percentage of short answers provided by the dataset which appear as exact substrings of the generated output. Note that for NQ, we report recall only over the top five gold answers following (5).

To report citation quality, we use a process aligned with (4) that follows exactly the citation metrics found in the ALCE framework (5): citation recall and citation precision. Citation recall is a measure of whether each generated statement includes citation(s) which entail it. Citation precision quantifies whether each individual citation is necessary to support a statement.

Confidence intervals. All metrics are computed for each query in the dataset, and averaged across all n queries. To characterize the spread of the distribution, we compute 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across queries using bootstrapping. That is, we resample n queries with replacement from the true distribution, compute the mean, and repeat this process for 1000 bootstrap iterations. We then find the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles for this distribution to yield the 95% confidence intervals. Note that these bootstrapped CIs can be used to determine whether the difference between two distributions is statistically significant (28).

# 4 Results

We first analyze how many retrieved documents should be included in the LLM context window to maximize correctness on the selected QA tasks. This is shown as a function of the number of retrieved nearest neighbors, $k$. Incorporating the retrieved documents narrows the performance disparity between the closed-book scenario ($k=0$) and the gold-document-only ceiling. However, the performance of the evaluated retrieval systems still significantly lags behind the ideal. ColBERT usually outperforms BGE by a small margin.

![Correctness achieved by Mistral with various numbers of documents retrieved with BGE-base and ColBERT. Optimal performance is observed with $k = 10$ or $20$.](assets/page_0004_img_1.png)

Correctness on QA begins to plateau around 5-10 documents. We find that Mistral performs best for all three datasets with 10 or 20 documents (Figure 2). LLaMA performs best when $k = 4$ or $5$ for ASQA and NQ, but $k = 10$ for QAMPARI (Appendix Figure 8). This difference between LLMs is likely due to LLaMA's shorter context window. We also find that adding the citation prompt to NQ results in almost no change to performance until $k > 10$. Tables 1 and 2 show that citation recall generally peaks around the same point as QA correctness, while citation precision tends to peak at much lower $k$. Since citation precision measures how many of the cited documents are required for each statement, this suggests that showing the LLM more documents (i.e. at higher $k$) results in more extraneous, or unnecessary, citations. Citation measures for other datasets and models are in A.4.

We further investigated where gold documents appear within the ranked list of retrieved documents. We found that gold documents typically ranked between 7-13th nearest neighbor (Appendix Table 6). Given these results, we conducted all subsequent analyses and experiments with 5-10 context documents, as these were generally good settings for QA performance even if some of the gold documents are missed.

Based on the results above, we hypothesized that the ideal number of documents to include in a RAG pipeline is directly related to the number of gold documents that are retrieved within that $k$. This is relatively unexplored in the literature, as most have investigated how well LLMs can utilize the context and ignore non-gold documents (16; 26; 29; 30). Because we observed similar trends across datasets, we dropped QAMPARI from the following results for simplicity. We re-analyze the results.

The above for $k = 10$ documents in the prompt, and simply bin the queries depending on the retriever recall (i.e., the percentage of retrieved gold documents).

## Including just one gold document highly increases correctness.

We observe a significant increase in the EM recall of queries with just one gold document in the prompt versus no gold documents. This is the case when either Mistral (Figure 3) or LLaMA (Appendix Figure 9) is used as the reader module. We note that this trend was also observed in (26).

## More gold documents correlate with higher correctness.

We find that increasing the number of gold documents in the prompt steadily increases QA correctness metrics. This is illustrated for Mistral in Figure 3 and LLaMA in Figure 9. We note that the difference in average correctness begins to plateau around a retrieval recall of 0.5. This supports the hypothesis that the ideal number of documents in the context window is directly related to the number of gold documents in that context window, in spite of the potential noise added by more non-gold documents.

### 4.1 Gold document recall and search accuracy regime

Next, we investigated how using approximate search affected RAG performance on the QA task. In particular, since the prior evidence suggests that gold documents are key to performance, we ran two sets of experiments to understand how both search recall and gold document recall affect QA performance. First, we took the gold set and replaced some of these to reach a gold document recall target of 0.9, 0.7, or 0.5. For each query, we sampled a subset of the gold documents so that the average gold recall across all queries in a dataset reached the target, and populated the rest of the 10 documents with the nearest non-gold neighbors. Second, we set the ANN search algorithm to achieve

| 0.7                  |                | 0.361 | 0.245 |

Citation metrics generally decrease as fewer supporting documents are available. We observed that decreases in document recall and search recall lead to decreases in citation metrics (full results in Appendix A.6). As with QA performance, decreases in document recall affect citation performance.

## 4.2 Injecting noisy documents of varying relevance

Next, we explored whether the relevance of the non-gold documents included in the context window affects the performance of the RAG pipeline on QA tasks. We define relevance as the similarity between the query and the retrieved document as defined by the correspondingRetriever. A prior work (7) made two claims about query-document similarity: (1) random non-gold documents increase QA performance above the gold-only ceiling; and (2) highly similar, non-gold documents are distracting and decrease QA performance.

To investigate claim 1, we added documents of varying similarity to either the gold set or the 5 most similar documents (nearest neighbor indices 0-4). First, we used BGE-base to retrieve all documents in the dataset for each ASQA query, assigning each neighbor a similarity score. We order the retrieved documents by this score and divide them into ten equal-sized bins. We define documents in the first bin 10th percentile noise, the second bin 20th percentile noise, etc. We randomly select 5 documents from each bin and append them to the prompt after either the gold or BGE-base retrieved documents. This setting follows the experiments in (7). Note that when injecting additional noise on top of the gold documents, the gold document recall (but not accuracy or F1) is still 1.0.

Our evidence does not clearly replicate claims in (7) about injecting noise. Contrary to claim 1, we find that adding noisy documents, regardless of their noise percentile, degrades correctness (Figure 5) and citation quality (A.7) compared to the gold-only ceiling.

![ASQA Mistral performance after injecting noisy documents from various percentiles of similarity to the query. Adding noisy documents from all percentiles degrades QA correctness.](assets/page_0007_img_1.png)
```

### --- Page 0008 ---

```markdown
Figure 5 also shows no consistent trend in performance changes with decreasing similar documents. However, it is possible that claim 2 – that very similar neighbors are more distracting than distantly similar neighbors – might only be observed if we take the 1$^{st}$ percentile of neighbors, as similarity is known to drop steeply with further neighbors (see Appendix Figure 6). We therefore repeated a similar experiment with samples from the first 100 neighbors to test this claim. We compare performance for Mistral on ASQA with 5 gold documents to performance when the 5$^{th}$ – 10$^{th}$ or 5$^{th}$ – 100$^{th}$ nearest neighbors are added (Table 5). Although QA performance still degrades, the effect is smaller—injecting more similar neighbors only drops performance by 1 point. Overall, injecting closer neighbors does not appear to be more detrimental than farther ones. Interestingly though, citation scores improve for farther neighbors. A similar pattern of QA performance was observed when using the same LLM as (7) (Appendix A.7).

These results are in line with 4.1. Due to how ANN graph search is parameterized (A.1.1), lowering search recall adds “noisy” non-gold documents that are still similar to the query. Here and in 4.1, we observed that injecting highly similar neighbors only mildly degrades downstream task performance.

|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
|                     | Mean      | 95% CI         | Mean      | 95% CI         | Mean      | 95% CI         |
| gold only           | 50.73     | 48.73 - 52.79  | 65.19     | 63.07 - 67.23  | 62.26     | 60.29 - 64.41  |
| gold + 5$^{th}$ – 10$^{th}$ | 49.91     | 47.82 - 51.90  | 57.40     | 61.40 - 53.45  | 53.15     | 57.62         |
| gold + 5$^{th}$ – 100$^{th}$ | 49.24     | 47.05 - 51.46  | 58.69     | 56.37 - 61.11  | 56.14     | 53.96 - 58.23  |

5 Conclusion

Overall, our experiments suggest that models that can retrieve a higher number of gold documents will maximize QA performance. We also observe that leveraging ANN search to retrieve documents with a lower recall results in only slight QA performance degradation, which correlates with the very minor changes to gold document recall. Thus, operating at a lower search recall regime is a viable option in practice to potentially increase speed and memory efficiency. We also find that, contrary to a prior study (7), injecting noisy documents alongside gold or retrieved documents degrades correctness compared to the gold ceiling. We also find that it has an inconsistent effect on citation metrics. This suggests that the impact of document noise on RAG performance requires further study.

Future work should test the generality of these findings in other settings. Understanding how approximative vs. exact search affects multi-vector retrievers such as (13) would be interesting, especially given their generally good performance. Additionally, we only evaluated systems where the retriever and reader are trained separately. RAG systems trained end-to-end (e.g. Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) (31) model), may rely less on gold documents such that retrieval metrics are not useful relevance markers (32).

# Appendix

## A.1 Experiment setup

We conduct the retrieval portion of the experiments on a 2-socket 2nd generation Intel® Xeon® 8280L @ 2.70GHz CPUs with 28 cores (2x hyperthreading enabled) and 384GB DDR4 memory (@2933MT/s) per socket, running Ubuntu 22.04. Retrieval results were saved to files and were inserted into the prompt (Figure 1) for the LLM during the reader portion of the experiments.

We ran an LLM inference on NVIDIA GPUs of varying models (NVIDIA Titan Xp or X Pascal series, or NVIDIA A40). The CPU host for these GPU nodes were either Intel® E5-2699 v4 or Intel® Xeon® 8280 or 8280L. Run time for generating answers for all queries in ASQA and QAMPARI was approximately 30 minutes for Mistral and 20 minutes for LLaMA. Because there are more queries in NQ, run time was approximately 1.5 hours for Mistral and 1 hour for LLaMA.

A temperature of 1 and top p of 0.95 were used for generation with both LLMs.

### A.1.1 Tuning ANN search

Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques that utilize graph structures are notable for their exceptional search accuracy and speed, particularly with data of high dimensionality (33; 34; 21). We leverage the Intel SVS library's graph-based search capabilities to our advantage. These graph-based approaches employ proximity graphs, in which the nodes correspond to data vectors. A connection is established between two nodes if they meet a specific property or neighborhood criterion, leveraging the natural structure found within the data.

The search process begins at a predetermined starting node and progresses through the graph, moving from one node to the next, each step bringing the search closer to the nearest neighbor by following a best-first search strategy. To prevent becoming trapped in a local minimum and to enable the discovery of multiple nearest neighbors, backtracking is employed (34; 35). Increasing the extent of backtracking means that a larger section of the graph is examined, which enhances the precision of the search but also results in a longer and therefore slower process. By adjusting the setting that determines the level of backtracking, we can fine-tune the balance between search accuracy, reflected in the quality of the nearest neighbors found, and the number of queries that can be handled per second. The Intel SVS library uses the `search_window_size` parameter to set the search accuracy vs. speed trade-off. By changing the `search_window_size` we set the retrieval module to operate at different search recall regimes.

# A.5 Additional varied number of gold documents results

Figure 9 shows the relationship between the number of gold documents in the prompt and correctness achieved on ASQA with LLaMA. In Figure 9 and 10 we present results comparing retriever recall and correctness.

## ASQA Number of Gold Documents vs. Correctness

![ASQA Number of Gold Documents vs. Correctness](assets/page_0017_img_1.png)

Figure 9: The per-query relationship between the number of gold documents included in the prompt and the QA accuracy achieved with LLaMA on ASQA. We find that including just one gold document significantly improves accuracy. There is a correlation between the number of gold documents and the accuracy.

# A.6 Additional recall manipulation results

![Llama results varying gold document recall and BGE-base search recall](assets/page_0018_img_1.png)

Generally, both citation recall and citation precision decrease as document recall and search recall decrease.

Since the ASQA dataset is more likely to contain multiple gold evidence documents per query, it is less consistently affected by decreases in document recall. For example, we see in Table 17 that between 0.7 and 0.9 search recall @10, citation recall is nearly identical for ASQA – the 95% CIs are nearly completely overlapping. However, this is not the case for the NQ dataset, which shows a consistent decrease as recall drops.

# A.7 Additional noise experiment results

In Table 19 we show detailed results for ASQA Mistral performance after injecting noisy documents from various percentiles of similarity to the query. These correspond to the correctness results in Figure 5 in the main body of the paper.

Table 20 shows the first 100 noise experiment for ASQA with Llama2 for augmenting both gold and BGE-base retrieved data with noise first in the prompt.

## Table 19: ASQA Mistral performance with gold or BGE-base retrieved documents (respectively) and noisy documents from various percentiles of similarity to the query. We find that adding noisy documents from all percentiles degrades both correctness and citation performance. There is no obvious correlation between the percentile of the noise and the degradation of performance.

## Abstract

This paper presents Structure Aware DeNse ReTrieVAl (SANTA) model, which encodes user queries and structured data in one universal embedding space for retrieving structured data. SANTA proposes two pretraining methods to make language models structure-aware and learn effective representations for structured data: 1) Structured Data Alignment, which utilizes the natural alignment relations between structured data and unstructured data for structure-aware pretraining. It contrastively trains language models to represent multi-modal text data and teaches models to distinguish masked structured data for unstructured texts. 2) Masked Entity Prediction, which designs an entity-oriented mask strategy and asks language models to fill in the masked entities. Our experiments show that SANTA achieves state-of-the-art on code search and product search and conducts convincing results in the zero-shot setting. SANTA learns tailored representations for multi-modal text data by aligning structured and unstructured data pairs and capturing structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the structured data. All codes are available at [https://github.com/OpenMatch/OpenMatch](https://github.com/OpenMatch/OpenMatch).

## 1 Introduction

Dense retrieval has shown strong effectiveness in lots of NLP applications, such as open domain question answering (Chen et al., 2017), conversational search (Qu et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021), and fact verification (Thorne et al., 2018). It employs pretrained language models (PLMs) to encode unstructured data as high-dimensional embeddings, conduct text matching in an embedding space and return candidates to satisfy user needs (Xiong et al., 2021b; KarpuKhin et al., 2020).

Besides unstructured data, structured data, such as codes, HTML documents and product descriptions, is ubiquitous in articles, books, and Web pages, and plays the same important roles in understanding text data. Learning the semantics behind text structures to represent structured data is crucial to building a more self-contained retrieval system. The structured data modeling stimulates researchers to build several benchmarks to evaluate model performance, such as code search and product search (Husain et al., 2019; Reddy et al., 2022). The structured data retrieval tasks require models to retrieve structured data according to user queries. Dense retrieval (KarpuKhin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022) shows a promising way to build a retrieval system on structured data by encoding user queries and structured data in an embedding space and conducting text matching using the embedding similarity. Nevertheless, without structure-aware pretraining, most PLMs lack the necessary knowledge to understand structured data and conduct effective representations for retrieval (Feng et al., 2022).

# 2 Related Work

Dense retrieval \cite{Yu et al., 2021; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021b; Li et al., 2021} encodes queries and documents using pretrained language model (PLM) \cite{Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020} and maps them in an embedding space for retrieval. However, during retrieving candidates, the documents can be passages in natural language \cite{Nguyen et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019}, images \cite{Chen et al., 2015}, structured data documents \cite{Lu et al., 2021} or multi-modal documents \cite{Chang et al., 2021}, which challenges existing dense retrieval models to handle different kinds of modalities of knowledge sources to build a self-contained retrieval system.

Existing work \cite{Guo et al., 2021} also builds dense retrievers for retrieving structured data and mainly focuses on learning representations for code data. Leaning more effective representations with PLMs is crucial for dense retrieval \cite{Gao and Callan, 2021; Luan et al., 2021}, thus several continuous training models are proposed. They usually employ mask language modeling to train PLMs on structured data and help to memorize the semantic knowledge using model parameters \cite{Wang et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2020; Rozier et al., 2021}. CodeBERT \cite{Zhang et al., 2020} uses replaced token detection \cite{Clark et al., 2020} and masked language modeling \cite{Devlin et al., 2019} to learn the lexical semantics of structured data \cite{Lu et al., 2021}. DOBF \cite{Rozier et al., 2021} further considers the characteristics of code-related tasks and replaces class, function and variable names with special tokens. CodeT5 \cite{Wang et al., 2021} not only employs the span masks strategy \cite{Raffel et al., 2020} but also masks the identifiers in codes to teach T5 \cite{Raffel et al., 2020} to generate these identifiers, which helps better distinguish and comprehend the identifier information in code-related tasks. Nevertheless, the mask language modeling \cite{Devlin et al., 2019} may not sufficiently train PLMs to represent texts and show less effectiveness in text matching tasks \cite{Chen et al., 2021; Gao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019; Li et al., 2020}.

The recent development of sentence representation learning methods has achieved convincing results \cite{Fang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021}. The work first constructs sentence pairs using back-translation \cite{Fang et al., 2020}, some easy deforming between user queries and structured data.

![The Structure-Aware Pretraining Methods of SANTA. We use both Structured Data Alignment (SDA) and Masked Entity Prediction (MEP) methods for pretraining.](assets/page_0003_img_1.png)

## 3 Methodology

In this section, we introduce our Structure Aware DeNse ReTrievAl (SANTA) model. First, we introduce the preliminary of dense retrieval (Sec. 3.1). And then we describe our structure-aware pretraining method (Sec. 3.2).

### 3.1 Preliminary of Dense Retrieval

Given a query $q$ and a structured data document $d$, dense retriever (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021a) encodes queries and structured data documents with pretrained language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019) and maps them in an embedding space for retrieval.

Following previous work (Ni et al., 2022), we can use $T5$ (Raffel et al., 2020) to encode the query $q$ and structured data document $d$ as low dimensional representations $h_q$ and $h_d$, using the representation of the first token from the decoder:

$$
h_q = T5(q); \quad h_d = T5(d). \tag{1}
$$

Then we can calculate the similarity score $f(q, d)$ between the representations of query $h_q$ and structured data document $h_d$:

$$
f(q, d) = \text{sim}(h_q, h_d), \tag{2}
$$

where $\text{sim}$ is the dot product function to calculate the relevance between query $q$ and structured data document $d$.

Finally, we can fine-tune the representations of query and document by minimizing the loss $L_{DR}$:

$$
L_{DR} = - \log \frac{e^{f(q, d^+)}}{e^{f(q, d^+)} + \sum_{d^{-} \in \mathcal{D}^{-}} e^{-f(q, d^{-})}}. \tag{3}
$$

where $d^+$ is relevant to the given query $q$. $\mathcal{D}^-$ is the collection of irrelevant structured data documents, which are sampled from inbatch negatives (Karpukhin et al., 2020) or hard negatives (Xiong et al., 2021a).

### 3.2 Structure Aware Pretraining

Existing language models are usually pretrained on unstructured natural languages with masked language modeling (Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). Nevertheless, these models struggled to better understand the semantics represented by data structures, which limits the effectiveness of language models in representing structured data for retrieval (Feng et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).

To get more effective representations for structured data, we come up with structure-aware pretraining methods, aiming to help language models better capture the semantics behind the text structures. As shown in Figure 2, we continuously fine-

## 3.2.2 Masked Entity Prediction

The masked entity prediction guides the language models to better understand the semantics of structured data by recovering masked entities. SANTA masks entities for continuous training instead of using the random masking in mask language modeling (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020). As shown in previous work (Sciavolino et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019), entity semantics show strong effectiveness in learning text data representations during retrieval. Thus, we first recognize mentioned entities that appeared in the structured data document $X_d = \{x_1, ent_1, x_2, ent_2, \ldots, ent_n\}$ and mask them as the input for T5 encoder module:

$$
X^{mask}_d = \{x_1, <mask>_1, x_2, <mask>_2, \ldots, x_n\},
$$

where <mask>$_i$ is a special token to denote the i-th masked span. We replace the entity with the same special token. Then we continuously train T5 to recover these masked entities using the following loss function:

$$
L_{MEP} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} -\log P(Y_d(t_j)|X^{mask}_d, Y_d(t_{1}, \ldots, t_{j-1})),
$$

where $Y_d(t_j)$ denotes the j-th token in the sequence $Y_d$. And $Y_d = \{<mask>_1, ent_1, \ldots, <mask>_n, ent_n\}$ denotes the ground truth sequence that contains masked entities. During training, we optimize the language model to fill up masked spans and better capture entity semantics by picking up the necessary information from contexts to recover the masked entities, understanding the structure semantics of text data, and aligning coherent entities in the structured data (Ye et al., 2020).

## 4 Experimental Methodology

In this section, we describe the datasets, evaluation metrics, baselines, and implementation details in our experiments.

### Dataset

The datasets in our experiments consist of two parts, which are used for continuous training and finetuning, respectively.

### Continuous Training

During continuous training, two datasets, CodeSearchNet (Husain et al., 2019) and ESCI (large) (Reddy et al., 2022), are employed to continuously train PLMs to conduct structure-aware text representations for codes and shopping products. In our experiments, we regard code documentation descriptions and product bullet

points as unstructured data for aligning structured data, codes and product descriptions, during training. More details of pretraining data processing are shown in Appendix A.2.

**Finetuning.** For downstream retrieval tasks on structured data, we use Adv (Lu et al., 2021), and ESCI (small) (Reddy et al., 2022) to finetune models for code search and product search, respectively. All data statistics are shown in Table 1. Each query in ESCI (small) has 20 products on average, which are annotated with four-class relevance labels: Exact, Substitute, Complement, and Irrelevant. We also establish a two-class testing scenario by only regarding the products that are annotated with the Exact label as relevant ones.

**Evaluation Metrics.** We use MRR@100 and NDCG@100 to evaluate model performance, which is the same as the previous work (Lu et al., 2021; Reddy et al., 2022; Feng et al., 2020).

**Baselines.** We compare SANTA with several dense retrieval models on code search and product search tasks.

We first employ three pretrained language models to build dense retrievers for structured data retrieval, including BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), which are widely used in existing dense retrieval models (Karpukhin et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2021a; Ni et al., 2022). All these models are trained with in-batch negatives (Karpukhin et al., 2020).

For the code search task, we also compare SANTA with three typical and task-specific models, CodeBERT (Feng et al., 2020), CodeT5 (Wang et al., 2021) and CodeRetriever (Li et al., 2022). CodeBERT inherits the BERT architecture and is trained on code corpus using both mask language modeling and replaced token detection. CodeT5 employs the encoder-decoder architecture for modeling different code-related tasks and teaches the model to focus more on code identifiers. CodeRetriever is the state-of-the-art, which continuously trains GraphCodeBERT (Guo et al., 2021) with unimodal and bimodal contrastive training losses.

**Implementation Details.** This part describes the experiment details of SANTA.

We initialize SANTA with T5-base and CodeT5-base for product search and code search. For masked entity prediction, we regard code identifiers and some noun phrases as entities in codes and product descriptions, respectively. More details about identifying entities are shown in Appendix A.3.

During continuous training, we set the learning rate as 1e-4 and 5e-5 for product search and code search, and the training epoch as 6. During finetuning, we conduct experiments by training SANTA using inbatch negatives and hard negatives. We set the training epoch to 60 and learning rate to 5e-5 for product search, while the training epoch and learning rate are 6 and 1e-5 for code search. And we follow ANCE (Xiong et al., 2021a), start from inbatch finetuned SANTA (Inbatch) model and continuously finetune it with hard negatives to conduct the SANTA (Hard Negative) model. The learning rates are set to 1e-5 and 1e-6 for product search and code search. These hard negatives are randomly sampled from the top 100 retrieved negative codes/product descriptions from the SANTA (Inbatch) model.

All models are implemented with PyTorch, Huggingface transformers (Wolf et al., 2019) and OpenMatch (Yu et al., 2023). We use Adam optimizer to optimize SANTA, set the batch size to 16 and the warmup proportion to 0.1 in our experiments.

## 5 Evaluation Results

In this section, we focus on exploring the performance of SANTA on code search and product search tasks, the advantages of SANTA in representing structured data, and the effectiveness of proposed pretraining methods.

### 5.1 Overall Performance

The performance of SANTA on structured data retrieval is shown in Table 2.

SANTA shows strong zero-shot ability by comparing its performance with finetuned models and achieving 6.8% improvements over finetuned CodeT5 on code search. Such impressive improvements demonstrate that our pretrained strategies have the ability to enable the advantages of PLMs in representing structured data without finetuning.

After finetuning, SANTA maintains its advantages by achieving about 8% and 2% improvements over CodeT5 and T5 on code search and

## 5.2 Ablation Study

In this subsection, we conduct ablation studies to further explore the roles of different components in SANTA on retrieving structured data.

We start from CodeT5/T5 models and continuously train CodeT5/T5 using proposed training tasks, Masked Entity Prediction (MEP) and Structured Data Alignment (SDA) to show their effectiveness in teaching models to better learn semantics from structured data. Meanwhile, we compare MEP with the random span masking strategy (Raffel et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) to evaluate the effectiveness of different masking strategies. The retrieval performance in both zero-shot and finetuning settings is shown in Table 3.

Compared with our baseline model, MEP and SDA show distinct performance in structured data retrieval. As expected, MEP shows almost the same performance as the baseline model. It shows that only mask language modeling usually shows less effectiveness in learning representations for structured data, even using different masking strategies. Different from MEP, SDA shows significant improvements in both structured data retrieval tasks, especially the code retrieval task. Our SDA training method contrastively trains T5 models using the alignment relations between structured data and unstructured data, which helps to bridge the modality gap between structured and unstructured data, maps structured and unstructured data into one universal embedding space, and learns more effective representations for retrieval. When adding additional task MEP to T5 (w/ SDA), the retrieval performance of SANTA is consistently improved. This phenomenon shows that mask language modeling is still effective to teach T5 to better capture the structure semantics and conduct more effective text representations for structured data by filling up the masked entities of structured data.

We also compare different masking strategies that are used during mask language modeling. Our entity masking strategy usually outperforms the random span masking strategy, showing the crucial role of entities in structured data understanding. With the masked entity prediction task, SANTA achieves comparable ranking performance with finetuned models, which illustrates that structure-

aware pretraining is starting to benefit downstream tasks, such as structured data retrieval. The next experiment further explores how these pretraining strategies guide models to learn representations of structured/unstructured data.

### 5.3 Embedding Visualization of Structured and Unstructured Data

This section further explores the characteristics of embedding distributions of structured and unstructured data learned by SANTA.

As shown in Figure 3, we first conduct experiments to show the retrieval effectiveness of CodeT5 and SANTA under the zero-shot setting. The ranking probability distribution of relevant query-code pairs is shown in Figure 3(a). Even though CodeT5 is pretrained with code text data, it seems that CodeT5 learns ineffective representations for structured data, assigning a uniform ranking probability distribution for all testing examples and fails to pick up the related structured data for the given queries. On the contrary, SANTA assigns much higher ranking probabilities to matched structured documents, demonstrating that our structured data alignment task has the ability to guide the model to conduct more effective text data representations to align queries with its relevant structured documents. Then we plot the embedding distribution of structured data in Figure 3(b). Distinct from the embedding distribution of CodeT5, the embeddings learned by SANTA, are more distinguishable and uniform, which are two criteria of learning more effective embedding space under contrastive training (Li et al., 2021; Wang and Isola, 2020).

Then we present the embedding distribution of documentation texts and their corresponding codes.

Figure 4: Embedding Visualization of Different Models using T-SNE. We randomly sample 32 codes and 32 code documentation texts from the testing set of code retrieval and plot their embedding distribution.

in Figure 4. Overall, depending on our structure-aware pretraining methods, SANTA conducts a more uniform embedding space than CodeT5 and makes the representations of structured and unstructured data more distinguished in the embedding space. Then we analyze the effectiveness of our continuous training methods, Masked Entity Prediction (MEP) and Structured Data Alignment (SDA). By comparing Figure 4(b) with Figure 4(a), our structured data alignment task indeed helps PLMs to align the representations of code and documentation, which reduces the distance between matched unstructured-structured data pairs and mixes the multi-modal embeddings thoroughly in the embedding space. After adding the masked entity prediction training task to CodeT5 (w/ SDA) (from Figure 4(b) to Figure 4(d)), the embedding distributions of code and documentation become distinguished again, demonstrating that masked entity prediction can help models capture different semantics from different data modalities to represent unstructured/structured data. Besides, by comparing Figure 4(d) with Figure 4(c), the structured data alignment task also makes the boundary of the embedding clusters of code and documentation clearer. The main reason lies in that these embeddings are assigned to appropriate positions for aligning matched code-documentation pairs with the help of our structured data alignment task.

![Code Search](assets/page_0008_img_1.png)
![Product Search](assets/page_0008_img_2.png)

CodeT5 (w/ SDA) and SANTA calibrate the attention weights from the “if” token to the “>” token. The “>” token is a logical operator, which indicates the usage of the code. SANTA thrives on the structured data alignment task and captures these important semantic clues to represent codes. Compared with CodeT5 (w/ SDA), SANTA decreases its attention weights on code identifiers, such as “x” and “y”, and shares more attention weights to “If” and “>”. These identifiers can be replaced with attribute ones and are less important than these logical operations to understand code semantics. Thus, SANTA adjusts its attention weights to logical tokens to understand structured data, which is benefited from pretraining with the masked entity prediction task.

Figure 5(b) shows the attention distribution on product search. T5 (w/ SDA) assigns more attention weights to the product attribute “Green” than T5, as well as highlights the sequence boundary tokens of product attributes. Nevertheless, for the product “privacy fence screen”, “Large” is a more important attribute than “Green”. SANTA captures such semantic relevance, which confirms that our masked entity prediction task indeed helps to improve the semantic understanding ability of language models on structured data.

5.4 Attention Mechanism of SANTA
This section presents the attention mechanism of SANTA during encoding structured data. In Figure 5, we randomly sample a small piece of code and a text sequence of product descriptions to plot the attention distribution.

The attention weight distributions on code search are shown in Figure 5(a). Compared with CodeT5,

## 5.5 Case Studies

Finally, we show several cases in Table 4 to analyze the ranking effectiveness of SANTA. In the first case, SANTA directly matches queries and codes through the text snippet “poll the driver status”. It demonstrates that SANTA has the ability to distinguish the differences between code and documentation and pick up the necessary text clues for matching queries and codes. Then the second case illustrates that SANTA is effective in understanding codes by capturing the structure semantics of codes and matching queries and codes by capturing some keywords in codes, such as “copied” and “path”. The last two cases are from product search and the product description is more like natural language. SANTA also shows its effectiveness on identifying some important entities, such as “Hair Dye” and “fence screen”, to match queries and products.

## 6 Conclusion

This paper proposes SANTA, which pretrains language models to understand structure semantics of text data and guides language models to map both queries and structured texts in one universal embedding space for retrieval. SANTA designs both structured text alignment and masked entity prediction tasks to continuously train pretrained language models to learn the semantics behind data structures. Our experiments show that SANTA achieves state-of-the-art on code and product search by learning more tailored representations for structured data, capturing semantics from structured data and bridging the modality gap between structured and unstructured data.

## Limitations

Even though SANTA shows strong effectiveness on learning the representation of structured data, it heavily depends on the alignment signals between structured and unstructured data. Such alignment relations can be witnessed everywhere, but the quality of constructed pairs of structured and unstructured data directly determines the effectiveness of SANTA. Besides, we use the product bullet points and code descriptions as the unstructured data in our experiments, which is designed for specific tasks and limits the model’s generalization ability. On the other hand, SANTA mainly focuses on evaluating the structured data understanding ability through text data representation and matching. It is still unclear whether SANTA outperforms baseline models in all downstream tasks, such as code summarization and code generation.

# A Appendix

## A.1 License
For all datasets in our experiments, Adv and CodeSearchNet use MIT License, while ESCI uses Apache License 2.0. All of these licenses and agreements allow their data for academic use.

## A.2 Construction of Pretraining Data
In this subsection, we show how to process the pretraining data and construct structured-unstructured data for code/product search. During pretraining, we use inbatch negatives to optimize SANTA and all data statistics are shown in Table 5.

As shown in Figure 6, we show some examples to show how to construct structured-unstructured data pairs for pretraining. For code retrieval tasks, code snippets have corresponding documentation descriptions, which describe the purpose and function of these code snippets. Thus, the code documentation and its corresponding code snippet are regarded as a positive training pair.

For product retrieval tasks, structured product descriptions usually have corresponding unstructured bullet points, which provide key points about the products. We randomly select one bullet point of items and use its corresponding product description to construct a positive training pair.

## A.3 Additional Experimental Details of Entities Identification on Structured Data
We show some examples of entity identifications on structured data in Figure 7.

For codes, we follow Wang et al. (2021) and regard code identifiers as entities such as variables, function names, external libraries and methods.

### Table 7: Data Statistics of CodeSearch Dataset
The document collections consist of candidate codes.

| Language | Query   | Train    | Dev     | Test     | Document  |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|-----------|
| Python   |         | 251,820  | 13,914  | 14,918   | 43,827    |
| PHP      |         | 241,241  | 12,982  | 14,014   | 52,660    |
| Go       |         | 167,288  | 7,325   | 8,122    | 28,120    |
| Java     |         | 164,923  | 5,183   | 10,955   | 40,347    |
| JavaScript|        | 58,025   | 3,885   | 3,291    | 13,981    |
| Ruby     |         | 24,927   | 1,400   | 1,261    | 4,360     |

Specifically, we use BytesIO and tree_sitter\footnote{https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter} to identify entities in Python and other programming languages, respectively. For product descriptions, we use the NLTK tool\footnote{https://www.nltk.org/} to identify nouns and proper nouns that appear in both product descriptions and titles and regard them as entities.

In our experiments, we replace the same entities with the same special tokens and ask SANTA to generate these masked entities (Eq. 7). These special tokens come from the predefined vocabulary of T5, such as `<extra_id_0>, <extra_id_1>, ..., <extra_id_99>`. The proportions of identified entities in pretraining data are shown in Table 5.

### A.4 Additional Evaluation Results of SANTA
In this experiment, we follow Li et al. (2022), keep the same evaluation settings and evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of SANTA on CodeSearch dataset. The dataset consists of code retrieval tasks on six programming languages, including Ruby, Javascript, Go, Python, Java, and PHP. We show the data statistics of CodeSearch in Table 7. Since CodeT5 and CodeRetriever don’t release their data processing code for pretraining, we can only refer to the tutorial\footnote{https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet/blob/master/notebooks/ExploreData.ipynb}. When we evaluate SANTA on CodeSearch, the instances in testing and development sets are filtered out from CodeSearchNet dataset for pretraining. Some codes that can not be parsed are also filtered out, because the data processing details are not available\footnote{https://github.com/salesforce/CodeT5/issues/64}.

During continuous pretraining, we set the batch size, learning rate and epoch as 128, 5e-5 and 10, respectively. During finetuning, we set the learning rate as 2e-5 and 1e-5 for CodeSearch and Adv, and set batch size and epoch as 128 and 12. We use inbatch negatives with one hard negative for finetuning and the hard negative is randomly sampled from the top 100 retrieved negative codes by pretrained SANTA. The warm-up ratio is 0.1.

The performance of SANTA on CodeSearch and Adv is shown in Table 6. Under the zero-shot setting, SANTA outperforms CodeRetriever (Li et al., 2022) by about 2% improvements, which shows that the advances of SANTA can be generalized to different structured data retrieval tasks. Moreover, SANTA also shows strong zero-shot ability by achieving comparable performance with the finetuned CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT and CodeT5 models. After finetuning, SANTA achieves more than 3.7% improvements over CodeT5 on CodeSearch. All these encouraged experiment results further demonstrate that our structure-aware pretraining method indeed helps language models to capture the structure semantics behind the text data. The retrieval performance on Adv dataset illustrates that the retrieval effectiveness of SANTA can be further improved by increasing the batch size from 16 to 128.
